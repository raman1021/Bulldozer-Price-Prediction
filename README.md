# Bulldozer-Price-Prediction
Here is the model using machine learning and data science tools which predicts the price of bulldozer.
It is a REGRESSION Problem as we have to predict a number here.
In this project we're using different scoring parameters to improve our model and to make efficient prediction.
Software used : Jupyter Notebook
Machine Learning tool : Scikit-Learn
Data Science tools : * Pandas
                     * Numpy
                     * Matplotlib
                     * Seaborn




Have a Great Learning !
